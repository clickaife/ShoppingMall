# Shopping Mall - OrderDetails Module

This repository contains the OrderDetails module of the Shopping Mall project, which is a part of the assignment given by TNSFoundation. The project is built using Core Java, SQL, and Spring Boot, and it utilizes Postman for API testing.

## Project Overview

The Shopping Mall project is divided into various modules, and this repository specifically handles the OrderDetails functionality. The OrderDetails module manages the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of order details within the system.

## Project Structure

The OrderDetails module is structured as follows:

- **OrderDetails.java**: Represents the entity model for the Order Details. It defines the attributes of an order, such as `orderId`, `productDetails`, `quantity`, `price`, etc.
  
- **OrderDetailsController.java**: This is the controller class that handles HTTP requests. It provides RESTful endpoints for performing operations on Order Details like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

- **OrderDetailsServices.java**: Contains the business logic for the OrderDetails module. It acts as a bridge between the controller and the repository, ensuring that the necessary operations are performed correctly.

- **OrderDetailsRepository.java**: This interface extends `JpaRepository` and provides methods for database interaction related to OrderDetails. It includes basic CRUD operations out-of-the-box.

## API Endpoints

The following operations can be performed using Postman:

1. **GET** `/orderdetails/{id}`: Retrieve the details of a specific order by its ID.
2. **POST** `/orderdetails`: Create a new order with the given details.
3. **PUT** `/orderdetails/{id}`: Update the details of an existing order.
4. **DELETE** `/orderdetails/{id}`: Delete an order by its ID.
